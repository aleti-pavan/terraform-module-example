# terraform-module-example

This contains simple code to make use of terraform modules which are on git repository.

In terraform we create modules with 'module {}' block.
source = 'can be git repo or your path on local disk where you have terraform code'

I should be writing a bit more notes when I have time, Stay tuned.
