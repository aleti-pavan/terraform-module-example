# terraform-module-example

This contains simple code to make use of terraform modules which are on git repository.

We have code on 'https://github.com/aleti-pavan/terraform-aws-wordpress.git' , but I have used 'git@github.com:aleti-pavan/terraform-aws-wordpress.git' as I have configured my git credentials with github if in case I need to push something to the repo. This shouldn't stop you anyways..!!!

In the above code 'main.tf' just replace the git@ url with https url and that's it you should be good to go ahead.
